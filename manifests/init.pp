#
# == Class: openvpn
#
# Class for setting up OpenVPN.
#
# Each server and client instance (=VPN connection) is configured separately in 
# openvpn::serverinstance and openvpn::clientinstance.
#
# == Parameters
#
# [*use_latest_release*]
#   Use latest release from the OpenVPN project. Valid values 'yes' and 'no'. 
#   Defaults to 'no', which means that the operating system's default packages 
#   are used. This currently only works for Debian-based operating systems: 
#   setting it to 'yes' on any other operating systems has no effect.
#
# == Examples
#
#   class { 'openvpn':
#       use_latest_release => 'yes',
#   }
